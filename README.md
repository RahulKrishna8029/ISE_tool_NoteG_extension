# ISE_tool_NoteG_extension

This Tool is an extension to the existing "NoteG" which is designed by Noble Mathews.

In the first release, we're showcasing the issues dealing with development in NoteG.

The initial refernce file is added which is of the game -> "sprite". 

The game I'm trying to build in the first release is "Pacman".
 
Reasons for choosing "Pacman" :
      
      - simpler layout and single screen
      
      - Since,there's an issue with animation and movement we're trying minimize complexity.
      
      
Our final goal with second release to enable Unity 2D templates as a part of the game prototype.
